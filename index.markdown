I'm a software developer. I grew up in Manchester, England and lived for a long time afterwards in London. Now I live in Berlin, Germany.

I'm currently Director of Engineering at [Latana](https://latana.com). Previously I was Staff Engineer at [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org).

I write and maintain a few [software projects](/projects) (although rarely find the time these days) and I sometimes [write about software and people](/articles). I was formerly a regular coach at [Ruby Monstas](http://rubymonstas.org/), which is a weekly [Rails Girls Berlin](http://railsgirlsberlin.de/) study group.

You can [write me an email](mailto:{{ site.email }}) and I'll do my best to answer.
